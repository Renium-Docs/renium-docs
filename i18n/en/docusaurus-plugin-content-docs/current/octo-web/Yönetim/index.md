# Management

The Management section is where you can configure overall system settings and manage permissions across different modules. Through this section, you can create user accounts, edit or delete existing users. You can also define roles, assign specific permissions to these roles, and manage system-wide notifications and informational messages. In short, the Management section allows you to control the systemâ€™s operation and manage user permissions from a centralized location.
